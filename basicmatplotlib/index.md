Here are the basic matplotlib graphing techniques I learned in my CTBA class. Note: in these files we use matplotlib.pyplot and pandas packages.
- [Basic Graphing (html)](BasicGraphAssignment.html)
- [Basic Graphing (ipynb)](BasicGraphAssignment.ipynb)

A repository focused on pandas here (check the index):
- [Pandas (repository)](https://github.com/githubmicah/pandas)
